# Medicare
In the United States, Medicare is a single-payer, national social insurance program administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax.

The data summarizes the utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers.

Medical cost in US is very high and the Medicare dataset has huge data related to the diagnosis and costs related to it. Goal of this project was to answer following questions:
  1. Total number of medications prescribed in each state.
  2. Most prescribed medicine in each state.
  3. States with most nursing facilities.
  4. Average cost for inpatient and outpatient treatment in each city.
  5. Most common inpatient diagnostic conditions in US, cities that have the most number for each diagnostic condition and the      average payments for these conditions in these cities and their comparison with the national average.
  6. Average HCC scores for different states and facilities.
  7. Comparison of nursing facilities across different states.
